################### <h1>Data Encryptions Standard (DES)</h1>

usings of Des algorithm with out using libirles 
using some  table for  Initial permute ,Final Permute, shifting , subistitution , controling the size of key ....ets
Deviding algorithm to  Funictions Helping to Understand and Maintenance and modifecations also 
distribution Tasks ... some of that Funiction :
1-Binary to string funiction  and opposite 
2-permute based in certsin table
3-subistitution boxes to chang the key from 48 bit unto 32bit using some methods and Boxes
4- genates Keys with that it follow 16 rounds th creat each one and append all key to list 
5-cut the block to detect and filter the message in each block 8 byte(64 bits)
.
.
. 
folow some ways to comleate 
after follow that using Encryptions funictin to Text <ciphertext>
in opposite in envers  using decryption funiction bet her we envers th keys
the 16th key in plaintext >>its first key in decryption


<h1> play fair algorithm</h1>
using numby libirey to switch the list or tuple to array 
U can determinr the comber of Row and Colun ....

Using arrays to making key 
and arrays in creation and oerder the letters 
then using shifting and chosing if thay in sane column or in same row or in differnce places
all one of that has funictions 









caiser algorithm using python with GUI
